<h1> Lessons Learned </h1>
First we read the README project together to understand the demands and requirements of the project and then, we draw all the pages and components on excalidraw. This gave us a good understanding of the workflows and points of attention.

We adopt some good practices that helped us during the development:
Read the README project together; understand the structure and workflow; we align methods and tools for better synchronous and asynchronous communication; combine availability periods during the weekdays; combine rest and pause moments; set informations and workflow on trello; set goals; transparency; combine good practices and, the most important -> feel free to ask for HELP!
